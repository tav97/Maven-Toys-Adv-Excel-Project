# Maven-Toys-Adv-Excel-Project
I recently completed an impactful project for Maven Toys, a national toy retailer, to help them better track and analyze their revenue patterns.

Maven Toys had monthly sales data spanning 18 months, from January 2020 to July 2021, broken down by dimensions like region, store type, product category and measures like units sold, revenue and profit. However, they lacked an effective way to slice and visualize this data to uncover trends and insights.
My project focused on building an automated Excel dashboard tracking monthly sales trends with advanced analytics

Key features include:

Regional Revenue Breakdown: Split monthly revenue by retail region to compare performance. Includes sparklines showing trends.

Calculated Store performance for each region. 
Used SUMIFS() & RANK.AVG() functions

Year over Year & Month over Month: Track revenue changes compared to previous years and months to spot growth/declines. Uses % difference and variance highlighting.

Used SUMIFS() function for the same

Top/Bottom Sellers: Rank products by revenue with conditional formatting to quickly see highest and lowest performers.

Used INDEX()& MATCH() Functions for the same

The interactive dashboard filters on region and date ranges so executives can analyze historical patterns and emerging shifts in different areas of the business.

I used Excel techniques like Top N formulas, relative date offsets for time comparisons, sorting pairs to rearrange on-the-fly and color scales to emphasize surprising variances. These bring the key numbers to the surface.

The launch of the new Maven Toys Revenue Dashboard created an intuitive, visual way to analyze their sales data and make informed decisions about regional targets, underperforming products and promotional strategies. The executives were very pleased with the simplified insights into sales drivers and trends across their national retail locations.

This project exemplifies how business intelligence initiatives can transform raw company data into impactful insights for strategy and growth. Let me know if you would like to discuss further!
